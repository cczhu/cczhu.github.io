Welcome to the repository for my personal webpage. [cczhu.github.io](https://cczhu.github.io/)!
This Jekyll site is forked from [Jerome Lachaud's port](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/grayscale-theme)
of the  [Grayscale bootstrap theme](http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-grayscale/),
but it is actually a combination of that theme and Dean Attali's
[Beautiful Jekyll theme](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/).  I definitely
recommend the latter to anyone looking to start a website without all the HTML/CSS/Jekyll
hassle!

Code was also derived from y7kim's [Agency Theme bootstrap port](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme),
and Tim O'Brien's [Single Paged theme](http://t413.com/SinglePaged/).
