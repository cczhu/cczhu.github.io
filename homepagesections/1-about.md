I'm a data science fellow at the [Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com/)
Toronto program.

My background is astrophysics.  I completed my PhD at the [University of
Toronto Astronomy Department](http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/) with [Prof. Marten van
Kerkwijk](http://astro.utoronto.ca/~mhvk/) on whether two white dwarf stars
colliding together can set off an explosion. Following graduation, I worked as
a postdoc to develop radio telescope data analysis software for the
Department's pulsar astronomers, and helped create a deep learning-based
impact crater detector with its planetary scientists.

Aside from work and research, I'm an
[avid amateur photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/115470406@N08/), and
connect with my astronomy roots by working in public outreach with
[universe.utoronto.ca](https://universe.utoronto.ca/).
