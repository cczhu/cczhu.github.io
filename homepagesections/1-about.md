I'm a research analyst in the Big Data Innovation Team of the City of
Toronto Transportation Services, working at the intersection of urban
planning and data science.

My background is astrophysics.  I completed my [PhD thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/1807/77419)
at the [University of Toronto Astronomy Department](http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/)
with [Marten van Kerkwijk](http://astro.utoronto.ca/~mhvk/) on whether two white
dwarf stars colliding together can set off an explosion. Following graduation,
I worked as a postdoc to develop radio telescope data analysis [software](https://github.com/mhvk/baseband)
for the Department's pulsar astronomers, and helped create a deep learning-based
[impact crater detector](https://github.com/silburt/DeepMoon) with its planetary scientists.
I transitioned into data science through the [Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com/)
Toronto program.

Aside from work and research, I'm an
[avid amateur photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/115470406@N08/),
[occasional digital painter](https://charlessketchstream.tumblr.com/), and a
public outreach facilitator with [universe.utoronto.ca](https://universe.utoronto.ca/).
