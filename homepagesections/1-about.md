I research white dwarfs, the remnants of Sun-like stars left behind after
they've exhausted their nuclear fuel.  Specifically, I investigate mergers of
two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs to determine if and how they produce type Ia
supernovae, the most powerful thermonuclear explosions in the universe.  While
supernovae are a hundred million times brighter than the Sun, white dwarf
themselves are incredibly faint, preventing direct observation of phenomena 
such as mergers by even the most powerful telescopes.  This makes computer 
simulations one of our most potent tool for understanding merger physics and 
post-merger evolution.

My work has utilized 3D hydrodynamic simulations to explore how properties of
the merged object, or "merger remnant", depend on the masses of the two merging
white dwarfs.  I have also examined how shear flows within the merger rapidly
generate powerful magnetic fields through magnetic dynamo action.  The
temperature and rotational profiles of the merger remnant, as well as the
presence of a magnetic field, shape the post-merger evolution of the remnant.
I am currently working with 1D semi-analytical models of this evolution to
quantify the influence of rotation and magnetic fields, and identify the
conditions that lead to an explosion.
